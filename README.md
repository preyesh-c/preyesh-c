## About me

I am a coding newbie

### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Preyesh and I am on the Software Engineering skills bootcamp!

This page is a short introduction to my journey into the world of coding!

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the language of Python
- âš¡ I like problem solving and to me, learning about code is like solving a puzzle!
